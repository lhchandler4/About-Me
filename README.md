# Project Title

This a page about me. It is a project I am working on in 201 practicing my HTML, CSS, and JS. 

## User Stories

I want to create an About Me page as a demonstration of my skills with HTML.
As an eventual jobseeker, I want to get practice in creating a portfolio page so that I can make myself appealing to potential employers.

As an eventual jobseeker, I would like for potential employers to quickly learn a few things about me, such as a short bio, my education, an overview of my job experience, and my goals.

As a fun-loving human being, I want to give the visitors to my About Me page a guessing game that shows how fun-loving and interesting I am, and maybe include things about myself that would not ordinarily appear in a portfolio page.

As a developer, I want to use markup to structure my index.html page, so the layout is in the order of assembly I prefer, with effective use of the markup possibilities offered by HTML.

As a developer, I want to carefully design my scripts, so I can understand how to organize and write my code to achieve my goals in interactivity.

As a developer, I want to create a simple script for my index.html page using JavaScript, so that I can use the browser to send a response to the user.

As a developer, I want to receive and use the userâ€™s name, so that the program is personalized to their experience.

As a developer, I want to provide five questions to the user, so that they can guess the answers and get to know me.

As a developer, I want to notify the user after each question, so they are aware whether they were correct or not in their answers.

As a developer, I want to be able to debug my code by using well structured console messages.

As a developer, I want to manage my code through an online version control system, so I have the ability to work with others, manage my revisions, and keep a thorough record of my progress.
